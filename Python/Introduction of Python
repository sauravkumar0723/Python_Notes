### Introduction of Python
- Python is a high-level, interpreted, and object-oriented programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
- It is widely used in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and software development.
- Created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

  Key Features of Python
- Interpreted Language
- Dynamically Typed
- Object-Oriented
- Extensive Standard Library
- Open Source
- Portable

# Hello World Program
print("Hello, World!")

     Summary of Python Code Execution Flow
1. Source Code: You write Python code in a .py file.
2. Python Interpreter: The interpreter reads your code and starts executing it.
3. Bytecode Compilation: The interpreter changes your Python code into bytecode (.pyc files).
4. PVM Execution: The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) takes the bytecode and changes it into machine code.
5. Machine Code: The CPU processes the machine code and performs the actions.
6. Output: The result of your program is displayed, such as printed text or calculations.
Additional Notes: JIT Compilers and Optimizations

What is the PVM?

- Think of the PVM as a translator that takes the bytecode and turns it into actions that your computer can understand. 
- The bytecode is platform-independent, which means it can run on any computer with Python installed. The PVM makes sure the bytecode gets turned into the right commands for your specific computer.
