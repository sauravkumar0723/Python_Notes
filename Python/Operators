### Operators
- Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values.
  Example:

a = 10
b = 5
print(a + b)   # Output: 15
🔹 Types of Operators in Python
1. Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical operations.
| Operator | Description    | Example  |
| -------- | -------------- | -------- |
| `+`      | Addition       | `a + b`  |
| `-`      | Subtraction    | `a - b`  |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `a * b`  |
| `/`      | Division       | `a / b`  |
| `//`     | Floor Division | `a // b` |
| `%`      | Modulus        | `a % b`  |
| `**`     | Exponent       | `a ** b` |

Example:
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)   # 13
print(a // b)  # 3
print(a % b)   # 1
print(a ** b)  # 1000

2️ Comparison (Relational) Operators

Used to compare values. Returns True or False.
| Operator | Meaning               |
| -------- | --------------------- |
| `==`     | Equal to              |
| `!=`     | Not equal to          |
| `>`      | Greater than          |
| `<`      | Less than             |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    |

x = 10
y = 20
print(x > y)   # False
print(x != y)  # True

3. Logical Operators
Used to combine conditional statements.
| Operator | Meaning                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| `and`    | Both conditions must be True |
| `or`     | At least one True            |
| `not`    | Reverse the result           |

a = 10
print(a > 5 and a < 20)  # True
print(not(a > 5))        # False

4. Assignment Operators
- Used to assign values.
Operator
| Operator | Example  |
| -------- | -------- |
| `=`      | `x = 5`  |
| `+=`     | `x += 3` |
| `-=`     | `x -= 2` |
| `*=`     | `x *= 2` |
| `/=`     | `x /= 2` |


5. Membership Operators
- Used to check if a value exists in a sequence.
| Operator | Meaning     |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `in`     | Present     |
| `not in` | Not present |

name = "Python"
print("P" in name)  # True

6.  Identity Operators
Used to compare memory location.

| Operator | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| `is`     | Same object      |
| `is not` | Different object |


Example:

a = [1,2,3]
b = a
print(a is b)  # True

7. Bitwise Operators?
Bitwise operators perform operations on numbers at the binary (bit) level.

| Operator | Name        | Description                         |                                        |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `&`      | AND         | Sets bit to 1 if both bits are 1    |                                        |
| `        | `           | OR                                  | Sets bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1 |
| `^`      | XOR         | Sets bit to 1 if bits are different |                                        |
| `~`      | NOT         | Inverts all bits                    |                                        |
| `<<`     | Left Shift  | Shifts bits to the left             |                                        |
| `>>`     | Right Shift | Shifts bits to the right            |                                        |


Left Shift (<<)
print(5 << 1)
Binary:
5  = 0101
<<1 = 1010
Output:
10
Left shift multiplies by 2.

6️⃣ Right Shift (>>)
print(8 >> 1)

Binary:
8  = 1000
>>1 = 0100
Output:
4
