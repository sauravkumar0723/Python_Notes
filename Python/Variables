 What is a Variable?
- A variable in Python is a name used to store data in memory.
- It acts as a container that holds a value which can be used and modified later in the program.

- Python is dynamically typed, which means you do not need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly.

 Syntax
- variable_name = value

Example:
age = 21
name = "Saurav"
cgpa = 8.5
is_student = True
